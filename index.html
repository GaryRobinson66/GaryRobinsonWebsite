        <h2 class="header">Rosslare Harbour</h2>
        <p>
            Rosslare Europort is a modern seaport located at Rosslare Harbour in County Wexford, Ireland, near the southeasternmost point of the island of Ireland. The port is a large Irish port serving the European Continent with 36 direct services to the Continent weekly. It handles passenger and freight ferries to and from Cherbourg, Dunkirk and Le Havre in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium, Bilbao in Spain, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock in the United Kingdom. As a result of Brexit, the port is expanding rapidly, providing new or increased direct sailings with extra capacity from Ireland to mainland Europe. The direct routes between Ireland and the continent allow freight transport firms to bypass the UK land bridge, in the case there is severe congestion at British ports.

            The port predominantly handles roll-on roll-off cargo ships and roll-on/roll-off passenger and freight vessels. The harbour has three cargo berths and a fishing vessel bert. Rosslare Europort has a Border Inspection Post, crucial for the importation of agri-food, fish or live animal products. It is the only one in Ireland outside Dublin Port. It is currently based in a 16-acre site 2 km from the port. Uniquely for Ireland, the Border Inspection Post offers a one-stop service for hauliers, as all necessary checks will be conducted on the same site (customs, agricultural and health inspections), so inspectors come to the hauliers rather than vice versa, saving them time and money. An advantage for Rosslare is that direct sailings allow drivers to take their rest periods during the crossing, rather than when they land in France or Spain. It appears that there is substantial demand from industry (manufacturers and producers) to use direct sailings to avoid the practical difficulties of using the landbridge such as documentation, redtape, inspections, and the need to use several IT systems. The same holds true for French business intent on avoiding Brexit-related delays and formalities by using the direct routes.

        <p>
            At Rosslare, Iarnród Éireann is an infrastructure provider and operator, providing port facilities and related services, including stevedoring, to shipping lines. Rosslare Europort is operated as a Common User Terminal, meaning that the port authority carries out all stevedoring activities on a common user basis for all shipping lines using the port. The import and export of trade cars is one of the most important trades of the port. In excess of 25,000 vehicles are handledthrought the port per annum. The importer depot is in Rosslare Harbour Village. The port can accommodate cruise liners. Rosslare Europort was included in the 2020 schedule of the Phoenix Reisen-owned liner MS Deutschland. In the Rosslare area, businesses have welcomed the boost in traffic going through the port and the town since Brexit. A local entrepreneur was cited by RTE as highlighting beneficial changes such as increased personnel around the area, as well as an increase in investment in local business.

            An all-weather RNLI lifeboat is on station, and the Irish Coast Guard helicopter at Waterford Airport provides air-sea rescue cover. An automatic weather station is maintained by Met Éireann. The port area is largely on reclaimed land. Reclamation work continued to the late 1990s when the northwest part of the port was constructed using a dragline. Rosslare has also handled rolltrailer traffic in the past, rolltrailers enable the carriage of lift-on lift-off traffic. Rosslare Europort is the second most strategically important seaport in the state after Dublin. It is the second-busiest port in terms of ship visits and gross tonnage. Rosslare handles more unitised freight than all other seaports in the state, excluding Dublin, put together. In the Rosslare area, businesses have welcomed the boost in traffic going through the port and the town since Brexit. Beneficial changes include a big increase in traffic and in people working in Rosslare Harbour. [1]
