            Viability of Construction Project
        </h2>
    A large proportion of this phase of the construction can be developed without any impact on the existing port operations as the construction is on the area adjoining the port facility. Phase one would enable freight to access the port along the new road and roundabout while check in at the new entry location.
    Port facilities are to be upgraded as part of government plans to meet customs, revenue, and agriculture and immigration controls post-Brexit with significant investment by Government. This investment along with the Rosslare Europort Masterplan will ensure that the port is Brexit ready and has the required facilities to meet future growth.
