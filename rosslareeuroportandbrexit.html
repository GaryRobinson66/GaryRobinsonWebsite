            The decision of the UK to leave the EU will result in changes.

                The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020 after both sides concluded a Withdrawal Agreement to facilitate an orderly departure. The Withdrawal Agreement provided for a transition period, which ended on 31 December 2020. In February 2023 the EU and the UK reached agreement on <a href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/businesses/brexit/info-businesses-trading-ni/trade-with-ni/windsor-framework.aspx"><span class="span">Windsor Framework</span></a>, a new way forward on the Protocol on Northern Ireland. The <a href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/businesses/brexit/info-businesses-trading-ni/trade-with-ni/windsor-framework.aspx"><span class="span">Windsor Framework</span></a> sets out joint solutions on customs, agri-food, medicines, VAT and excise, as well as new instruments to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are better heard. The UK Government announced in August 2023 its new approach to controlling imports of goods to Great Britain from the EU (including Ireland) in the UK Border Target Operating Model (TOM) which will apply from January 2024. The new UK controls will have implications for all Irish exporters to Great Britain, particularly agri-food exporters, including those using the UK Landbridge. It is vital that impacted businesses in Ireland speak to everyone in their supply chain including transport and logistics providers and customers in Great Britain to examine what adjustments will be needed to comply with the new UK requirements.

                Export health certificates and phytosanitary certificates will be required for medium risk animal products, plants and plant products imported to Great Britain from the EU, including from Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prenotification of imports of SPS goods from Ireland on the UK's SPS import system (IPAFFS) will be required (this requirement already applies to imports of such goods from the rest of the EU since 1 January 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                Documentary checks and physical and identity checks at the border will be introduced for medium risk animal products, plant and plant products imported to Great Britain from the EU, excluding those goods being imported from Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
                Existing inspections of high-risk plants/plant products from the EU will move from point of destination in Great Britain to UK Border Control Posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Safety and Security declarations for EU imports will come into force.
            </p>
            <p>
                Documentary and risk-based identity and physical checks on medium risk animal products, plants, plant products and high-risk food and feed of non-animal origin from Ireland will be introduced at ports on the west coast of Great Britain (the date for the commencement of physical checks for non-qualifying goods moving from the island of Ireland will be confirmed in autumn 2023).
            </p>
            <p>
                This will apply to a wider range of agri-food goods than is currently the case, including products of animal origin and all regulated plants and plant products. It will be based on a risk categorisation of high, medium, and low risk as defined by UK Government, depending on country of origin and product definition.
